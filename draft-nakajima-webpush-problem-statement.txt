Problem Statement and Requirements for Emergency Notification using Web

            draft-nakajima-webpush-problem-statement-latest

Abstract

   The Web Push protocol provides a means of delivering the events to
   clients based on the registration made by the application.  Also, the
   emergency alert notification system has been developed and deployed
   widely with mobile phones or smartphones, but has not deployed to
   Web-only devices.

   This document outlines various existing emergency alert notification
   system in other protocols and use cases with their requirements.

1.  Introduction

   The delivery of real-time events such as incoming calls or messages
   is an essential feature of mobile application and its platform.  The
   Web Push [I-D.thomson-webpush-http2] protocol has been proposed to
   enable delierying the events required by W3C Web Push API [PushAPI].

   Also, emergency alerting is an apparently important feature of
   telecommunication network such as cellular networks, allowing the
   goverments or authorities to send a warnings of natural disaster or
   accident.

   In the cellular network, several emergency alerting mechanisms have
   been proposed and merged into Public Warning System(PWS)
   [_3GPP.22.268].  PWS provides several functions for example:

   o  Able to broadcast Warning notifications to multiple devices
      simultaneously.

   o  Able to broadcast Warning notifications based on geographical
      information.

   o  Provides reliable, secure delivery of Warning notification over
      3GPP system.

   Addition to PWS, some work has been made to distribute the emergency
   alerting notification on different network.  In the WiFi network,
   IEEE 802.11u [IEEE80211u] has an emergency support which uses Common

   Alerting Protocol (CAP) [CAP].  Also, Atoca WG has worked for
   defining the secure alerting format to broadcast CAP-based alert over
   IP network.

   Those previous contribuions have been made to improve

   This document will describe various use cases and requirements of
   emergency notification system using Web Push.

2.  Terminology

   In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
   document back on established shorthands for expressing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these
   is described in [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

3.1.  Issues on existing emergency alerting system

   o  Rely on specific underlaying technology (e.g. 3GPP, 802.11u)

   o  Geo-based notification

3.2.  Use case of Web Push Emergency Alerting Notification

   o  Web-based Signage

   o  OTT emergency alerting system (local goverment or authorities)

3.3.  Non-emergency, Important notifivation

   o  Incoming call

4.  Security Consideration

   TBD

5.  IANA Consideration

   TBD
