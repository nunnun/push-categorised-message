                    Categorized Message for Web Push
         draft-nakajima-webpush-push-categorized-message-latest

Abstract

   The Web Push protocol provides a means of delivering the events to
   clients based on the registration made by the application.  This
   document describes extentions to that protocol that enables the
   categorized message delivery based on priority.

   This allows an application to request that a web push server deliver
   the prioritized message to a registered client.

1.  Introduction

   The delivery of the prioritized message, especially emergency
   message, is a common feature of push notification services.  This
   document describes a mechanism based on the Web Push protocol
   [I-D.thomson-webpush-http2].

   A new header field is added to the Web Push push response message.
   This header field identifies a category that lets push server
   delivering message with priority.  Application can use the category
   to send a push message with priority.

2.  Terminology

   In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
   document back on established shorthands for expressing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these
   is described in [RFC2119].

3.  Categorized push subscription

   A new header field "Push-Category" is provided in subscribe request
   to indicate priority of new subscription.

   POST /subscribe/1G_GIPMorg_n-IrQvqZr6g HTTP/1.1 Host:
   push.example.net Push-Category: Normal

   The "Push-Category" HTTP header field is an OPTIONAL header field
   that, when used, indicates a priority of push subscription and its
   delivery.

   The following categories are defined:

   normal: "normal" category indicates that push subscription

   important: "important" category indicates that push channel MUST be
   delivered prior to "normal" push channel.  Application MUST send a
   push message with stream which has a higher weight compared to
   Default stream priorities defined at [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2].

   emergency: "emergency" category indicates that push channel MUST be
   delivered prior to any other categorized or uncategorized push
   channel.  User Agent MUST send a aggregated channel creation request
   [I-D.thomson-webpush-aggregate].  Application MUST send a push
   message with stream which has a highest weight compared to other
   stream on the connection.

4.  Security Considerations

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies the HTTP header field listed below, which has
   been added to the "Permanent Message Header Field Names" registry
   defined in [RFC3864].

   Header field: Push-Catagory Applicable protocol: http Status:
