                    Categorized Message for Web Push
         draft-nakajima-webpush-push-categorized-message-latest

Abstract

   The Web Push protocol provides a means of delivering the events to
   clients based on the registration made by the application.  This
   document describes extentions to that protocol that enables the
   categorized message delivery based on priority.

   This allows an application to request that a web push server deliver
   the emergency message to a registered client.

1.  Introduction

   The delivery of the prioritized message, especially emergency
   message, is a common feature of push notification services.  This
   document describes a mechanism based on the Web Push protocol
   [I-D.thomson-webpush-http2].

   A new header field is added to the Web Push push response message.
   This header field identifies a category that lets push server
   delivering message with priority.  Application can use the category
   to send a push message with priority.

2.  Terminology

   In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
   document back on established shorthands for expressing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these
   is described in [RFC2119].

3.  Categorized push subscribe

   A new push "subscribe"
